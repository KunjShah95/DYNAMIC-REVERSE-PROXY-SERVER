## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to the **Dynamic Reverse Proxy Server** project! This server is designed to dynamically manage and route incoming requests to various backend services based on configurable rules. It's perfect for microservices architectures and scalable applications.

## 📚 Features

- **Dynamic Routing**: Easily configure routing rules without restarting the server.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic evenly across multiple backend services.
- **SSL Termination**: Secure your connections with SSL/TLS.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrated logging and monitoring for better insights.

## 🛠️ Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KunjShah95/dynamic-reverse-proxy-server.git
cd dynamic-reverse-proxy-server
npm install
```

## 🚦 Usage

Start the server with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Configure your routing rules in the `config.json` file:

```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "path": "/service1",
      "target": "http://localhost:3001"
    },
    {
      "path": "/service2",
      "target": "http://localhost:3002"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
npm test
```

## 📅 Future Updates

- [ ] Add support for WebSocket proxying
- [ ] Implement advanced load balancing algorithms
- [ ] Enhance security features with rate limiting and IP whitelisting
- [ ] Provide a web-based dashboard for configuration management
